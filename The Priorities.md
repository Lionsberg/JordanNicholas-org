## What's Next

As the movement and resources grow, we intend to articulate and publish detailed strategies, plans of action, executive orders, and legislation associated with each of the core priorities, and the additional issues they encompass and subsume. 

These plans of action will then be prioritized and interrelated into a System Wide Master Plan, which will in turn inform the quarterly planning process of the new government post-election. 

It will be the responsibility of US Citizens to only vote for legislators and executives across the nation who are aligned with and have publicly pledged to implement the New Covenant and the New Vision and Plan.
