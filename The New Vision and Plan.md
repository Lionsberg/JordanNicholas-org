# The New Vision and Plan

Without a guiding and uniting Vision, people and societies perish. At this crucial juncture in human history, it is imperative that we rapidly rediscover and reunite around a shared Vision of a flourishing and abundant world that is One Under God. 

I have set forth a New Vision and Plan in [Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint For a Better Future](https://lionsberg.wiki/lionsberg_wiki_books/beyond_the_meta_crisis/beyond_the_meta_crisis_-_a_blueprint_for_a_better_future) and other writings. 

Simply, it is the eternal vision of the Kingdom of God, on Earth as it is in Heaven. 

Progressively realizing this **Vision and Intention** requires a massive shift in human spirit and consciousness, an unprecedented awakening that impels humanity towards unity and right relationship through Love.
