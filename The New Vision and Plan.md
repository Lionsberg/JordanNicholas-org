# The New Vision and Plan

A radical transformation of human spirit, consciousness and society calls forth a radical New Vision and Plan. 

Without a guiding and uniting Vision, people and societies perish. 

A house or mind fragmented and divided against itself cannot stand. 

At this crucial juncture in human history, it is imperative that we rapidly rediscover and reunite around a shared Vision of a flourishing and abundant world that is One Under God. 

I have set forth a New Vision and Plan in [Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint For a Better Future](https://lionsberg.wiki/lionsberg_wiki_books/beyond_the_meta_crisis/beyond_the_meta_crisis_-_a_blueprint_for_a_better_future) and other writings. 

Simply, it is one with the universal and eternal vision of the New World, or World To Come, illuminated by prophetic voices for millennia. It is the vision of the world as the Creator intends it to be, right here **on Earth as it is in Heaven**.  

Progressively realizing this **Vision and Intention** requires a massive shift in human spirit and consciousness, an unprecedented awakening that impels humanity towards unity and right relationship through Love. 

This is [[The Mission]].
