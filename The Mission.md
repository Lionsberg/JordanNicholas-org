# The Mission 

The Mission is the Kingdom of God, on Earth as it is in Heaven. This is The Goal. 

This requires winning the spiritual war for the hearts and minds of humanity, vanquishing corruption and injustice, filling up all that is lacking, removing everything that doesn't belong, and regenerating society and our planet. 

The Intention is diverse, flourishing, and abundant Life, Love, and Right Relationship between the Creator and All Creation. 

Specific early milestones include broadcasting, spreading the word, aggregating resources and public support, resurrecting the Spirit of America and reconciling it to the Spirit of God, restoring the independence and integrity of the United States, and then transforming the conditions to afford citizens around the world the opportunity to develop towards the fullness of their unique potential, and flourish in diverse harmony. 

Additional specifics can be found under [[Priorities]].
