On Earth as it is in Heaven means that if it belongs in Heaven, it belongs here on Earth, and if it has no place in Heaven, it has no place here on Earth. 

This understanding impels us to fill up all that is lacking, and remove everything that doesn't belong in our lives and our world. 

Through this co-creative process, Heaven 'descends' and touches the Earth, in-breaking and displacing the Old with the New.
